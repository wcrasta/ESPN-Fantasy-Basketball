<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p> The code scrapes the "Season Stats" table from the League Standings page. It then compares a team's stats for the
    whole season against the stats for every other team and computes the score. The result of all these comparsions are
    displayed in the link above for the user to see. Teams with more wins against their peers are ranked higher in the
    "Season Rankings".</p>
