**NOTE:** As of April 22, 2023, this project is no longer being maintained.

https://espnfantasy.warrencrasta.com

An application that calculates and displays various statistics for ESPN Fantasy Basketball leagues. The code/application works for (public) leagues of any size that use H2H Most Cat. scoring. It may or may not work for other scoring systems. A Yahoo equivalent is [here](https://github.com/wcrasta/yahoo-fantasy-basketball).

If you liked this project, please consider starring the repository.

Due to performance limitations that occur when the code is deployed on the website, there are some useful features that **only exist locally** but are not available through the website. To view these, run the code in the [more-features branch](https://github.com/wcrasta/ESPN-Fantasy-Basketball/tree/more-features).

## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment using [venv and Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (optional, but highly recommended). Activate the virtual environment.
2. Run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install the dependencies for this project.
3. Open your favorite IDE and configure the project so that the Python interpreter + package sources comes from your virtual environment (optional, but highly recommended).
4. Download [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and put it in your path, preferably somewhere within your virtual environment. Instructions vary by OS. You might have to Google where to properly place ChromeDriver to get it working.
5. Run or debug the program!

## Improvements/Possible Added Features
Feel free to contribute to this project! There are many improvements that can be made, both in terms of code quality and in terms of whole new ideas that can be implemented. Both the front-end and back-end are simple and can be enhanced.

If you do contribute, be advised that it may take some time to get your PR merged in. If you're interested in being a collaborator, e-mail me.
